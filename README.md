Simulating the profit and expense of a restaurant in R

A restaurant is open every day. On weekdays, sales are approximately normal with a mean of $2000 and a standard deviation of $500. On the weekends, sales are approximately normal with a mean of $3000 and a standard deviation of $700. The rent costs $2500 weekly, labor costs $4500 weekly, food costs $4500 weekly, and other expenses amount to $2500 weekly.

Use simulation (unless otherwise specified) to answer the following questions:

1)	In any given week, what is the probability that the restaurant is making money?

2)	What is the probability that they lose money in December 2019?

3)	What is the yearly expected profit of the business? [Assuming all costs remain constant.]

4)	[For this question, you don’t have to use simulation to support all your claims, if you want. There isn’t a definitive right or wrong question here. Make assumptions as needed. I’ll grade you based on insight and coherence.] The manager is thinking about running a marketing campaign which costs $10000. The probability that the marketing campaign is successful is 80%. If it is successful, average sales on weekdays and weekends will increase by 15% (the standard deviation will stay the same). Would you recommend running the marketing campaign? Why or why not?
